		<span>Bob Ross, the painter and television personality, was a prolific artist who purportedly completed 30,000 paintings during his lifetime. Bob Ross wanted everyone to believe that they could be artists. While some may not like Bob Ross’ paintings, there are very few people who dislike the artist. </br> </span>
		<span>Robert (Bob) Norman Ross was born in Daytona Beach, Florida on October 29, 1942 to Jack and Ollie Ross. Bob Ross’ father was a carpenter and builder. For a time, Bob worked with his father doing carpentry. From his mother, Ollie, Bob learned a love and respect of wildlife.</br> </span>
		<span>Bob Ross has been dead twenty years. However, his stardom continues to grow. There are Bob Ross Clubs; T-shirts display his image and sayings; and Internet memes poke fun at his soothing spoken aphorisms described by his business partner, Annette Kowalski, as “liquid tranquilizer.” He lives on as a cultural meme. Lego figures, Halloween costumes, and cartoons of Bob are ubiquitous on the Internet. It's easy to imagine that Bob would love to see his work embraced and celebrated by so many people in their own individual and collective ways.</br> </span>
		<span>Despite Bob Ross’ international fame, no comprehensive critical biography with substantiated facts from primary sources exists. It is as if Bob Ross lives outside of any larger artistic, educational, and/or entertainment context. Instead, the Bob Ross story is told through word of mouth, narratives recorded in fanzines, posts on message boards, blog postings, Internet tribute pages, obituaries, feature stories in the popular press, Wikipedia entries, and Bob Ross, Inc. publications. This lack of vetted historical information has contributed to Bob Ross being more of a legend that an important historical figure in the art world. </span>
